# neuralnetwork
demo1.py, demo2.py, demo3.py ran for i_network1.py, i_network2.py, i_network3.py respectively.             https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning has the copyright of i_network1.py, i_network2.py, i_network3.py.   

expand_mnist.py used to expand training dataset,in order to reduce overfitting. When running expand.mnist.py, we will get a file named mnist_expanded.pkl.gz under data.                                                                                                                                                  
pic1 and pic2 are my own notes about neuralnetwork.
